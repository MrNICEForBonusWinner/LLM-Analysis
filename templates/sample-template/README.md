## Summary

Short summary on functionality and used technologies.

<!--
Please provide a high-quality screenshot of your solution below. It should be stored in a folder called `assets`. 

If possible, use a resolution of 1920x1080.

If your solution uses a placeholder screen and requires the user to configure it, please use a screenshot of the solution as it appears **after** it has been configured.

You can add as many screen shots as you'd like to help users understand your solution without having to download it and install it.

![Local Workbench Incompatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Local%20Workbench-Incompatible-red.svg "EXPLAIN WHY IT WORK WORK IN LOCAL WORKBENCH")

  Otherwise:
![Local Workbench Compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Local%20Workbench-Compatible-green.svg)

  If your web part needs permissions before working in the hosted workbench, let people know;
![Hosted Workbench (Requires permissions))](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hosted%20Workbench-(Requires%20permissions%)-yellow.svg "Requires permissions to be granted before this solution can work on the hosted workbench")

  or:

 If you specifically built and tested this web part to work with Teams, use this for the Teams compatibility tag:
    ![Teams Yes: Designed for Microsoft Teams](https://img.shields.io/badge/Teams-Yes-green.svg "Designed for Microsoft Teams")
 And if you know for sure that it is NOT compatible with Teams, use this:

## Prerequisites

<!--
Any special pre-requisites? Include any lists, permissions, offerings to the demo gods, or whatever else needs to be done for this web part to work.

Please describe the steps to configure the pre-requisites. Feel free to add screen shots, but make sure that there is a text description of the steps to perform.
 
-->

## Minimal path to awesome

<!-- 
PRO TIP:

For commands, use the `code syntax`

For button labels, page names, dialog names, etc. as they appear on the screen, use **Bold**

Don't use "click", use "select" or "use"

As tempting as it may be, don't just use images to describe the steps. Let's be as inclusive as possible and think about accessibility.

### Using the solution zip

* [Download](./solution/solution.zip) the `.zip` from the `solution` folder
* Within **Power Apps Studio**, import the solution `.zip` file using **Solutions** > **Import Solution** and select the `.zip` file you just packed.
* Open the app in edit mode and make sure the data source **Data source name** is connected correctly.

### Using the source code

You can also use the [Power Apps CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/data-platform/powerapps-cli) to pack the source code by following these steps::

* Clone the repository to a local drive
* Pack the source files back into a solution `.zip` file:

  ```bash
  pac solution pack --zipfile pathtodestinationfile --folder pathtosourcefolder --processCanvasApps
  ```

  Making sure to replace `pathtosourcefolder` to point to the path to this sample's `sourcecode` folder, and `pathtodestinationfile` to point to the path of this solution's `.zip` file (located under the `solution` folder)
* Within **Power Apps Studio**, import the solution `.zip` file using **Solutions** > **Import Solution** and select the `.zip` file you just packed.
